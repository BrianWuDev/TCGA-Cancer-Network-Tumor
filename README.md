#  Gene Association Network Visualization

This repository presents an interactive web-based tool for visualizing a gene association network centered on **GCH1** in normal tissues. Genes with a high Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC â‰¥ 0.8) to GCH1 are displayed as nodes within a tissue-specific cluster layout.

** Web Application**

##  Features

- **Centralized network** focused on GCH1
- **Tissue-specific clustering** for co-expressed genes
- **Interactive controls**:
  - Click and drag nodes to reposition
  - Scroll wheel to zoom in and out
  - Drag background to pan across the network
- **Information on hover**: View details for each node
- **Layout optimization**: Automatically rearrange node positions
- **High-resolution PNG export** with title and legend

##  Instructions

1. Open the web app using the link above.
2. **Navigate** the network:
   - Drag nodes to adjust the layout manually.
   - Use the mouse wheel to zoom.
   - Drag the background to move the full view.
3. **Hover** over a node to view its identifier and correlation score.
4. Use the **Optimize Layout** button to auto-adjust clusters.
5. Use the **Download PNG** button to export the current view.
